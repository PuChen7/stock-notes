I graduated on May 2018 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science. Currently, I'm working as a Software Engineer at State Street. As an alumni of Rutgers University, I truly enjoyed my learning experience during my undergraduat years. It gave me a great qualification to work as a professional software engineer. 
I'm planning to pursue my Master Degree at Rutgers. I'd like to discuss with an adivisor of graduate program for some specific questions. Becuase of my work schedule, I only have time on this Friday(4.19) afternoon. Could you please let me know if any advisor is available at that time period?
